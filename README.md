# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project is a simply task scheduler that a user can use to plan their workday within one hour time blocks. The information is saved to Local Storage and the page checks the hour every fifteen minutes to color code the timeblocks as to the ones in the past in gray, the current one in red, and the ones in the future in green. 

## Usage

The site is currently deployed for review on [github pages](https://vulpesviator.github.io/05-work-day-scheduler/). 

To run this application locally, clone or download the repo which contains the necssary html, css, and js files.

1. After the page loads, the user can click within a block of time and type their reminder
2. Clicking the blue save icon will save that text to Local Storage. 
3. When the user navigates back to the page, it will check Local Storage for previously saved items and populate them in the appropriate time block.
